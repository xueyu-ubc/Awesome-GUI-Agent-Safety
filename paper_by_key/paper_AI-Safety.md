    - 📖 TLDR: Existing LLM safety classifiers are limited by binary labels and delayed detection. We introduce Qwen3Guard, a multilingual safety model series featuring: (1) Generative Qwen3Guard for fine‑grained tri‑class classification (safe/controversial/unsafe). (2) Stream Qwen3Guard for real‑time, token‑level monitoring during streaming generation.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper presents v0.5 of the AI Safety Benchmark by the MLCommons AI Safety Working Group, designed to evaluate safety risks of chat-tuned AI systems. Version 0.5 covers a single English chat use case with typical, malicious, and vulnerable personas. It introduces 13 hazard categories, with tests for seven, totaling 43,090 prompts. The release includes benchmark specifications, a grading system, the ModelBench evaluation platform, an example report, and documentation of limitations. Version 1.0, planned for late 2024, will offer broader safety insights.
