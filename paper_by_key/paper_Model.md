    - 📖 TLDR: Existing LLM safety classifiers are limited by binary labels and delayed detection. We introduce Qwen3Guard, a multilingual safety model series featuring: (1) Generative Qwen3Guard for fine‑grained tri‑class classification (safe/controversial/unsafe). (2) Stream Qwen3Guard for real‑time, token‑level monitoring during streaming generation.
